# Common Challenges of DRL Application Development  
Replication package of "Common Challenges in Development of Deep Reinforcement Learning Applications: An Empirical Study" paper.  
<br>  
**data** directory includes the extracted and used data for this study. Also, a preview of the carried out survey and its detailed results exists in **survey** directory.   

<br>  
To extract DRL-related repositories, we used _'deep reinforcement learning'_ keyword as the search word whithin GitHub search API. Here is a sample of query to extract repositories having 'deep reinforcement learning' in their description, and have been created between _'2020-01-01'_ and _'2020-02-01'_.  

`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=deep+reinforcement+learning+pushed:2020-01-01T00:00:00Z..2020-02-01T00:00:00Z&order=asc&per_page=100&page=1`
