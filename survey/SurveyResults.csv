1. Diversity- researchers use RL in different domain. However, many tutorials cover the RL for a very specific domain/application. For example, many tutorials use Cart Pole as their example. But, different researchers might like to see more serious examples related to their field.

2. Hands-on- Broadly speaking, machine learning and deep learning tutorials are distinguished between two themes: 1. Research-based and 2. development-based. Tutorials from category one cover a wide range of background that is needed to learn ML/DeepL in depth. The second category focuses on teaching how to use the existing techniques without having to learn the mathematical background. Doing so, they help their audience spend their time only as much as required for their purpose. However, many RL tutorials combine some background knowledge with hands-on, which often leads to these two undesirable situations: 1- they cover none of the background and hands-on in depth and with variety 2- audiences have to spend a lot of time to read things that may not be necessary for their purpose
